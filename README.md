# L-Shell
Replace the shell with a CL REPL. Because I don't want to learn bash.

### Installation
Either run the script with it installed via quicklisp, or run (repl)

### Currently Implemented
- cd
- ls 
- cp
- substring searches
- directories showing in the input tab
- touch
- mkdir
- Direct bash commands output to string for useage

### TODO
- make the script look nice from real terminals (rlwrap?)
- symlinks
